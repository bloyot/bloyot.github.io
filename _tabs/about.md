I'm currently a Software Engineer from the Hartford Connecticut area, working for Blizzard Entertainment. I've also previously worked for Disney and ESPN. Outside of work, I enjoy playing video games (particularly fighting games and ARPGs), playing saxophone, and spending time with my wife, our two kids, and our dog.
