### Introduction
I've been dabbling in game dev for a little while now, and though I've made a [few small games](https://bloyot.itch.io/) and cloned a few arcade classics (in the spirit of the [20 games challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/)) I've been wanting to try and build something a bit more ambitious. However, like most software engineers, my personal github is a graveyard of half finished prototypes and side projects that seemed interesting at first but never got off the ground. So with that in mind, I thought I would create a dev log for my next project with the hopes that it would keep me a little bit more on track, as well as providing a nice snapshot of the work over time. 

### The game
So what do I actually want to build? I've only got a very loose conception of a game right now, a lot of which could very well change as I start building, but I've got a couple core ideas I want to try and meld together.

First, I've been kicking around the idea of making a turn based tactics game inspiried by things like `Into the Breach` and `Tactical Breach Wizards`. I particularly like the way these games present on a very small scale (single rooms that function almost like puzzles, that are visually detached from the world) but provide a ton of depth through choice. This style of game is also very appealing as mainly a programmer who is not much of an artist, as it requires much less art and animation than a 3d game or even a more complex 2D game like a platformer. plex Instead I can keep the art intentionally simple and lean much more heavily into the systems design and mechanics. 

Secondly, I've been playing a ton of Path of Exile lately, and while not at all mechanically or visually similar to a tactics game, the way the procedural endgame and meta-progression works is something that would be particularly cool to try and bring to a tactics game. While I certainly don't expect to build out the entire 15 years of complex systems in PoE's endgame (nor do I think it would work with the structure of tactics game), I am inspired by one particular piece: the way you roll maps to generate the content that you want to play. The key idea here
